## ðŸ“– Project Descriptions
### Exercise 01 - Data Center Energy Consumption Analysis
- Analyzes the power consumption profile of a data center under different operational conditions.
- The Python code calculates the **Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)** and visualizes the energy distribution between IT equipment and cooling systems.
- For further details, see the dedicated `README.md` inside the `Exercise_01` folder.

### Exercise 02 - Air to Water Heat Pump Analysis
- Examines the performance of an air-to-water heat pump in a residential heating setup.
- The code evaluates the **Coefficient of Performance (COP)** and heating power across five steady-state conditions.
- For more information, see the `README.md` inside the `Exercise_02` folder.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
All codes are implemented in **Python**. 
To execute them follow the instructions provided in each exercise's `README.md`.
